### dotconfigs
These are config files that I have tuned over past few years. Settings are borrowed from vimrc files of other github users and also have some of my own additions.
I do not remember when I started tuning my vimrc and where I borrowed settings from. Without a doubt VIM tips wiki has been one of the source.
