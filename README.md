### dotconfigs
For some time, I was thinking of version controlling config files on github. Finally it happened after one of colleague expressed a wish to look at them.

These are config files that I have tuned over past few years. Settings are borrowed from vimrc files of other github users and also have some of my own additions.

I do not remember when I started tuning my vimrc and where I borrowed settings from. Without a doubt VIM tips wiki has been one of the source.

I use keyboard with Swedish layout and so key mappings are tuned to make my life easier with Swedish layout.

This is a work in progress and I do not really expect anyone to use these configs. These files are for my own use and I keep changing them all the time to find a suitable setting.

Being said, you are free to copy settings from these files if you like. But if some change breaks things for you; you are on your own.
